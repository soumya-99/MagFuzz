                                Kathy has been interested in learning theory
                                since her days as a game designer (she wrote
                                games for Virgin, MGM, and Amblin’). She
                                developed much of the Head First format while
                                teaching New Media Authoring for UCLA
                                Extension’s Entertainment Studies program.
                                More recently, she’s been a master trainer for Sun
                                Microsystems, teaching Sun’s Java instructors how
                                to teach the latest Java technologies, and a lead
                                developer of several of Sun’s Java programmer
                                and developer certification exams. Together
                                with Bert Bates, she has been actively using the
                                concepts in Head First Java to teach hundreds of
                                trainers, developers and even non-programmers.
                                She is also the founder of one of the largest Java
                                community websites in the world, javaranch.

                                Just one problem. Your brain’s trying to do you a big favor. It’s
                                trying to make sure that this obviously non-important content
                                doesn’t clutter up scarce resources. Resources that are better
                                spent storing the really big things. Like tigers. Like the danger of
                                fire. Like how you should never again snowboard in shorts.
                                And there’s no simple way to tell your brain, “Hey brain, thank
                                you very much, but no matter how dull this book is, and how

                                programmers were given the same spec and told to
                                “build it”. The Really Annoying Project Manager
                                forced the two coders to compete,

                                the Silicon Valley guys have. Larry, the
                                procedural programmer, and Brad, the
                                OO guy, both knew this would be a piece
                                of cake.

                                himself, “What are the things this program
                                has to do? What procedures do we need?”.
                                And he answered himself , “rotate and
                                playSound.” So off he went to build the
                                procedures. After all, what is a program if not
                                a pile of procedures?
                                Brad, meanwhile, kicked back at the cafe
                                and thought to himself, “What are the things
                                in this program... who are the key players?” He
                                first thought of The Shapes. Of course, there
                                were other objects he thought of like the User, the Sound,
                                and the Clicking event. But he already had a library of code
                                for those pieces, so he focused on building Shapes. Read
